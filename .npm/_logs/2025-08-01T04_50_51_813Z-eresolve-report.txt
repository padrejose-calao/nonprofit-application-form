# npm resolution error report

While resolving: nonprofit-application-form@1.1.0
Found: react@18.3.1
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^19" from @welldone-software/why-did-you-render@10.0.1
node_modules/@welldone-software/why-did-you-render
  dev @welldone-software/why-did-you-render@"^10.0.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
