## Props Interface
```typescript
interface GovernanceSectionProps {
  boardMembers: BoardMember[];
  committees: Committee[];
  contacts: unknown[];
  groups: string[];
  narrativeFields: Record<string, unknown>;
  documents: Record<string, unknown>;
  onBoardMemberAdd: (member: BoardMember) => void;
  onBoardMemberUpdate: (contactId: string, updates: Partial<BoardMember>) => void;
  onBoardMemberRemove: (contactId: string) => void;
  onCommitteeAdd: (committee: Committee) => void;
  onCommitteeUpdate: (committeeId: string, updates: Partial<Committee>) => void;
  onCommitteeRemove: (committeeId: string) => void;
  onNarrativeChange: (fieldId: string, content: string) => void;
  onDocumentUpload: (fieldId: string, file: File) => void;
  className?: string;
  locked?: boolean;
}
```

## How It Works
1. ModuleHeader provides top-level CRUD controls
2. Organization structure type selection sets governance model
3. Board members are managed through ContactSelector integration
4. Demographics are calculated automatically from contact data
5. Committees can be pre-defined or custom
6. Attendance tracking supports board and committee meetings
7. All fields respect the lock state from ModuleHeader

## Next Steps
- Implement actual export functionality (PDF, TIFF, Email)
- Complete attendance tracking implementation
- Add meeting minutes editor
- Implement board evaluation tools
- Add conflict of interest tracking
- Create term limit notifications

## Notes
This is the complete advanced version with all features that were developed in the last 48 hours, now properly integrated with ModuleHeader for full CRUD functionality.
