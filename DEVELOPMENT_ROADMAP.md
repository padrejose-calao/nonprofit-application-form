## API Endpoints to Implement

```javascript
// Contacts
POST   /api/contacts/search
POST   /api/contacts/create
PUT    /api/contacts/update/:id
GET    /api/contacts/:id

// Documents
POST   /api/documents/upload     ✅ (referenced)
GET    /api/documents/:id
GET    /api/documents/form/:formId
DELETE /api/documents/:id

// Form
POST   /api/form/save-draft
POST   /api/form/submit
GET    /api/form/load/:id
POST   /api/form/export/:id

// Reference Data
GET    /api/states/list
GET    /api/countries/list
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Install Redux Toolkit**
   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
   ```

2. **Create Redux Store Structure**
   - Set up store configuration
   - Create form slice
   - Create contacts slice
   - Create documents slice

3. **Build ContactSelector Component**
   - Search functionality
   - Create new contact modal
   - Edit existing contact

4. **Complete Organization Identity Section**
   - Integrate ContactSelector
   - Add language/accessibility fields
   - State registration logic

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented using React state and conditional rendering
2. **File Uploads**: Using FormData API with JWT authentication
3. **Validation**: Client-side with regex patterns, server-side pending
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with color-coded sections
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Large File Uploads**: Already configured Git LFS
2. **Performance**: Plan to implement lazy loading and virtualization
3. **Security**: JWT tokens, file type validation, CSRF protection planned
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Target modern browsers, progressive enhancement

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All form sections functional
- [ ] <2s page load time
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance
- [ ] 100% type coverage
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Mobile responsive on all devices

## Notes for Team

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Maintain color coding for sections
- Use existing constants file
- Document all API endpoints
- Write tests for critical paths
