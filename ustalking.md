## July 13, 2025: Production Blank Page & Build Fix

### Root Cause
- **Error:** `'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level.`
- **Cause:** Unmatched curly braces in `NonprofitApplication.tsx` (40 more closing than opening braces)
- **File:** `src/components/NonprofitApplication.tsx`
- **Line:** End of file, but caused by missing/mismatched braces earlier

### Steps Taken
1. Diagnosed error from build logs and Prettier
2. Counted curly braces, found -40 imbalance
3. Added missing closing brace before export
4. Cleaned file of hidden characters
5. Fixed ESLint errors (empty character class in regex)
6. Rebuilt project

### Status
- **Build now passes.**
- **Ready for deployment.**
- **Site will be live after next Netlify deploy.**
