# Governance Module CRUD Restoration - August 1, 2025

## Summary
Successfully restored the Governance module with full CRUD functionality using ModuleHeader integration.

## What Was Restored

### 1. Module Header Integration ✅
The GovernanceSection now includes the standardized ModuleHeader component with:
- **Lock/Unlock**: Controls edit access to fields
- **Draft/Final Status**: Toggle between draft and final states
- **Export Function**: Export governance data (implementation pending)
- **Print Function**: Print governance information (implementation pending)
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Board Members, Committees, and Meetings

### 2. Board Members Management ✅
- **Add Board Member**: Create new board members with form fields
- **Edit Board Member**: In-line editing of all fields
- **Remove Board Member**: Delete functionality with confirmation
- **Fields**:
  - Name (required)
  - Role/Title (required)
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Term Start Date
  - Term End Date
- **Integration**: Shows count of board members from contacts

### 3. Committees Management ✅
- **Add Committee**: Create new committees
- **Edit Committee**: In-place editing of committee details
- **Remove Committee**: Delete committees with confirmation
- **Fields**:
  - Committee Name (required)
  - Committee Chair
  - Description

### 4. Board Meetings Management ✅
- **Add Meeting**: Record new board meetings
- **Remove Meeting**: Delete meeting records
- **Meeting Types**: Regular, Special, Annual
- **Fields**:
  - Meeting Date (required)
  - Meeting Type (required)
  - Topics/Agenda
  - Quorum Met (checkbox)

## File Location
`/Users/padrejose/non-profit-profile/src/components/sections/GovernanceSection.tsx`

## Source
Restored from: `/Users/padrejose/Downloads/src/components/sections/GovernanceSectionUpdated.tsx`

## Key Features
1. **State Management**: Tracks isLocked, isDraft, and isFinal states
2. **Field Locking**: When locked, all input fields become read-only
3. **Tab Navigation**: Clean UI with three tabs for different aspects
4. **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all actions
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## How It Works
1. The ModuleHeader provides CRUD controls at the top
2. Three tabs organize content: Board Members, Committees, Meetings
3. Lock toggle disables/enables all form fields
4. Draft/Final toggles mark the status of the data
5. Export and Print functions are placeholders for future implementation

## Next Steps
- Implement actual export functionality (PDF, TIFF, Email)
- Implement print functionality
- Add more advanced features like attendance tracking
- Integrate with document upload for meeting minutes
